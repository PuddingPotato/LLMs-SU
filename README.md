## Development of an AI Model for Course Recommendation and Academic Planning in University Curriculums Using Large Language Models
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system for intelligent course recommendation and study planning using Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by LangChain.
  
---

##📌 **Overview**
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to support AI-driven course recommendation and study planning. The system connects multiple components—including data retrieval, embeddings, and large language models—using the LangChain framework, with LangSmith for model monitoring and evaluation.

##🧠 **Models Used**
**Large Language Models (LLMs):**

- LLaMA 3.3 70B

- TYPHOON AI 2 70B

**Embedding Models:**

- Cohere Multilingual 3.0

- BGE M3
  
---

##🔍 **Key Findings**
Cohere Multilingual 3.0 performs better than BGE M3 in retrieving relevant academic data.

**The best-performing combination:**

- Embedding: Cohere Multilingual 3.0

- LLM: TYPHOON AI 2 70B

**Achieved precision = 0.825, demonstrating high-quality information filtering.**

##🌐 **Data Source**
- Course information was collected via web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

- The source website: Faculty of Science, Silpakorn University.

- The dataset covers the latest academic year: 2567 (2024).
